# CodeBusters

The Code Busters are a small team of attractive software developers who fix broken code for a fee. This Web API service will allow users to submit tickets to the Code Busters, who will then assess each ticket on an individual basis.

The Code Busters Api is reliant upon the Ticket Entity. Once a user submits a ticket, the team of code busters will send back an assessment with estimated time to complete and cost of the fix, and a response containing the solution to the problems of the code.
